# MipSdk-Dotnet-File-Quickstart

This sample application demonstrates using the Microsoft Information Protection SDK .NET wrapper to label and read a label from a file. 

This sample illustrates basic SDK functionality where it:

- Obtains the list of labels for the user
- Prompts to input one of the label IDs
- Prompts for a file path of a file to label
- Applies the label
- Reads the label from the document and displays metadata

## Summary

This sample application illustrates using the MIP File API to list labels, apply a label, then read the label. All SDK actions are implemented in **action.cs**. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2015 or later with Visual C# development features installed

### Sample Setup

In Visual Studio 2017:

1. Right-click the project and select **Manage NuGet Packages**
2. On the **Browse** tab, search for *Microsoft.InformationProtection.File*
3. Select the package and click **Install**

### Create an Azure AD App Registration

Authentication against the Azure AD tenant requires creating a native application registration. The client ID created in this step is used in a later step to generate an OAuth2 token.

> Skip this step if you've already created a registration for previous sample. You may continue to use that client ID.

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com and log in as a global admin.
> Your tenant may permit standard users to register applications. If you aren't a global admin, you can attempt these steps, but may need to work with a tenant administrator to have an application registered or be granted access to register applications.
2. Click Azure Active Directory, then **App Registrations** in the menu blade.
3. Click **View all applications**
4. Click **New Applications Registration**
5. For name, enter **MipSdk-Sample-Apps**
6. Set **Application Type** to **Native**
7. For Redirect URI, enter **mipsdk-auth-sample://authorize**   
  > Note: This can be anything you'd like, but should be unique in the tenant.
8. Click **Create**

The **Registered app** blade should now be displayed.

1. Click **Settings**
2. Click **Required Permissions**
3. Click **Add**
4. Click **Select an API**
5. Select **Microsoft Rights Management Services** and click **Select**
6. Under **Select Permissions** select **Create and access protected content for users**
7. Click **Select** then **Done**
8. Click **Add**
9. Click **Select an API**
10. In the search box, type **Microsoft Information Protection Sync Service** then select the service and click **Select**
11. Under **Select Permissions** select **Read all unified policies a user has access to.**
12. Click **Select** then **Done**
13. In the **Required Permissions** blade, click **Grant Permissions** and confirm.

### Update Client ID, RedirectURI, and Application Name

1. Open **app.config**.
2. Replace **YOUR CLIENT ID** with the client ID copied from the AAD App Registration.
3. Replace **YOUR REDIRECT URI** with the Redirect URI copied from the AAD App Registration.
4. Replace **YOUR APP NAME** with the friendly name for your application.
5. Replace **YOUR APP VERSION** with the version of your application.

## Run the Sample

Press F5 to run the sample. The console application will start and after a brief moment displays the labels available for the user.

- Copy a label ID to the clipboard.
- Paste the label in to the input prompt.
- Next, the app asks for a path to a file. Enter the path to an Office document or PDF file.
- Finally, the app will display the name of the applied label.
- Attempt to open the file in a viewer that supports labeling or protection (Office or Adobe Reader)
